# Project : Rock Paper Scissors

Third project of the Odin Project

## Description

Rock, paper, scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time. 
The rules are very simple: 
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

The goal of the project is to make a web browser's console game in JavaScript that enables a user and the computer to play against each other.
